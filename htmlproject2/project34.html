    <!--* Void Elements / EMPTY ELEMENTS -->
    <!--? Not all parts of a web page use the usual pattern of having an opening tag, some content, and then a closing tag. Some parts only need a single tag to work. These are called "void elements. -->
    
    <!-- Here are a few more examples of void elements:
        
     <img>: This is used to insert images. You only need to use <img> and provide attributes like src (source) and 
      alt (alternate text).
     <input>: This is used for input fields, like text boxes or checkboxes.
     <link>: This is used to connect to external resources like stylesheets or icons.
     <hr>: This creates a horizontal line to separate content. -->
