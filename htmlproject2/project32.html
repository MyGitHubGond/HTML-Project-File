<!-- Meta Tags for Metadata: -->

<!-- Meta tags are HTML elements that provide metadata about a webpage.

Here are some common uses of meta tags: -->

<!-- <meta charset="UTF-8">: Specifies the character encoding for the webpage, ensuring proper rendering of characters.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: Sets the viewport properties for responsive design.
<meta name="description" content="A brief description of the webpage">: Provides a concise description of the page's content.
<meta name="keywords" content="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3">: Specifies relevant keywords for search engines (not as impactful as it used to be).
<meta name="author" content="Author's Name">: Indicates the author of the webpage.
<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">: Instructs search engine robots (also known as crawlers or spiders)  whether to index and follow links on the page. -->
